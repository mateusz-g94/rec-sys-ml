### 1. Overview

The project shows how to build a <b>modern recommendation system</b> based on the architecture of neural networks.
<br><br>The goals of the project are:
- Train the recommendation engine
- Structure the project 
- Train the model
- Build the pypi package locally
- Build the pypi package in AWS CodeArtefacts
- Build CI/CD pipeline for building pypi package in the AWS 

This is the first of two parts. The second part of the project will be in a separate repository and will concern building a <b>Flask REST API</b> that will share predictions from the model.
